Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed pangenesis, which used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction. Although Mendel's work was largely unrecognized after its first publication in 1866, it was 'rediscovered' in 1900 by three European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak, who claimed to have reached similar conclusions in their own research.\",\n          \"The Republic of the Congo received full independence from France on August 15, 1960.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood\\u2013brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.\",\n          \"In military affairs, the use of infantry with specialised roles increased. Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries.[AB] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Actually running Experiment 1\n","questions, real_contexts, shuffled_contexts, correct_answers, choices, correct_context_question_choice_combos, incorrect_context_question_choice_combos = [], [], [], [], [], [], []\n","\n","\n","total_rows = 1000\n","\n","for ind in range(total_rows):\n","  row = data.iloc[ind]\n","  questions.append(row['Question'])\n","  real_contexts.append(row['Context'])\n","  shuffled_contexts.append(row['Shuffled Context'])\n","  correct_answers.append(row['Answer'])\n","  choices.append([row['Choice_1'], row['Choice_2'], row['Choice_3'], row['Choice_4']])\n","\n","  options = {\n","      'A' : row['Choice_1'],\n","      'B' : row['Choice_2'],\n","      'C' : row['Choice_3'],\n","      'D' : row['Choice_4']\n","      }\n","  correct_context_question_choice_combos.append({\n","      'Context' : row['Context'],\n","      'Question' : row['Question'],\n","      'Options' : options})\n","  incorrect_context_question_choice_combos.append({\n","      'Context' : row['Shuffled Context'],\n","      'Question' : row['Question'],\n","      'Options' : options})\n","\n","print(len(questions))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vYoEoU_kuae-","outputId":"1b2a3fd9-6594-4391-8c53-037a3a3e4d6f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715114787377,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":476,"user":{"displayName":"Ansh Riyal","userId":"02343793477263441040"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1000\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ind = 10\n","print(f'Question:\\n{questions[ind]} \\n\\n\\nReal Context:\\n{real_contexts[ind]} \\n\\n\\nShuffled Context:\\n {shuffled_contexts[ind]} \\n\\n\\nCorrect Answer:\\n{correct_answers[ind]} \\n\\n\\nChoices:\\n{choices[ind]} \\n\\n\\nCorrect_context_question_choice_combo:\\n{correct_context_question_choice_combos[ind]} \\n\\n\\nIncorrect_context_question_choice_combo:\\n{incorrect_context_question_choice_combos[ind]}')\n","# print()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YE6k43PZ1KiK","outputId":"85d58752-0430-45f4-c6dc-f8136e079960","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715114787377,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Ansh Riyal","userId":"02343793477263441040"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Question:\n","What person was the Director of the Science Museum at Notre Dame in the late 19th century? \n","\n","\n","Real Context:\n","Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874.
